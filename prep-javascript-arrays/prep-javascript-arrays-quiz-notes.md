## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the principal use of arrays?

Arrays are typically used for lists and collections of other data types.

- Describe the syntax (structure) of array-literals in JavaScript.

Arrays are defined by using square brackets [] and adding comma delineated values between the opening and closing brackets.

- What number represents the **first** index of an array?

0

- How can you access the last element of an array?

Arrays have a property on them named length which stores the number of items currently in the array. You can then access the last element of the array by using bracket notation; the index would be the result of (length - 1), since the first element is represented by 0.
