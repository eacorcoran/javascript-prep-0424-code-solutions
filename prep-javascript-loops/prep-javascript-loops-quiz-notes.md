## Quiz Questions

Answer the following questions in the provided markdown file before turning in this exercise:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?

A conditional expression that evaluates to true is needed to start a `for` and `while` loop.
They won't stop unless the conditional expression evaluates to false at some point.

- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?

It runs once before the loop begins to iterate and it typically is used to define the index variable.

- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?

It runs before each iteration of the loop and it defines the conditional expression which defines when the loop should stop iterating.

- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?

It runs after the code block of the loop for each iteration of the loop and it is typically used to update the value of the index variable.

- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?

It is typically used to update the value of the index variable.

- What types of data should the `for...in` loop be used on?

for...in loops should be used for objects, not arrays or strings
